## Week 01

On our first week we had to develop the Figma prototype of the landing page for MegaRocket GYM SA. a gym brand.
The first instance of the project was a group activity, me and my partner Ignacio Galcer√°n were in charge of the design.
We base the construction of it following the example given by the tutors and the weekly planning. We use the resources and components available in the UI-Kit (a pre-designed Figma file), we also include fonts, icons and images to reach the final result.
It was our first experience using Figma, it was a challenge that we managed to carry out working as a team with good communication.

## Week 02

This week the work mode was individual. I started by reviewing the documentation and intensively reading the week planning.
Then progressively I was creating the HTML file, first making the basic structure and then adding the necessary components, always thinking about creating a semantic structure that facilitates accessibility and SEO.
This landing page has a header, a side navigation bar, a main, and several content sections within it, also has a contact form and a footer.
The purpose is to start shaping the prototype of the landin page developed in week 01.

### **Structure components**

The tags used in the HTML document are:

## Week 03

We started making corrections in the HTML file and reviewing the documentation and the tasks to be developed, this week it was time to implement the styles in CSS.
It's a new structure, we begin to see the visual changes in our landing, the page that we have been working on since the first week begins to take shape.
The weekly objective is to create a static design, understand the use of classes, properties and their attributes, also to understand the connection between files.
The task is to work with CSS styles, have to name the classes correctly, avoid the excessive use of properties such a position absolute and relative. Also can not use flexbox and grid and the measure unit used in the project should be only pixels.

### **Styles properties**

This are the most important properties used in the project:

<details><summary>CLICK ME</summary>

<p>

1. `Box Model Properties:`
These properties include "width", "height", "padding", "border", and "margin". They control the size, spacing, and borders of HTML elements on the page.

2. `Display Property:`
This property control how HTML elements are displayed on a web page. For example, you can use the "display" property to control whether an element is treated as a block or inline element.

3. `Font Properties:`
These properties control the font family, size, style, and weight of text in HTML elements. They include "font-family", "font-size" and "font-weight".

4. `Color Properties:`
These properties control the color of text, backgrounds, and borders in HTML elements. They include "color", "background-color", and "border-color".

5. `Positioning Properties:`
These properties control the position of HTML elements on a web page. They include "position", "top", "right", "bottom", and "left". For example, you can use the "position" property to control whether an element is positioned relatively or absolutely.

## Week 4

Moving on to the 4th week the challenge within the weekly problem was to work on our HTML document and this time develop it using the Flexbox properties in CSS.
To do so, we incorporated new CSS components, where we applied css to different sections of the html: We worked the header in header.css, the main (with all its sections) in main.css, the footer in footer.css and the styles applied to more than one element were worked in styles.css. The rules of this week were to understand how flexbox works and the relative units of measures, and also to dabble in Media Queries since the main objective was to develop our Landindig page (with mobile first methodology) using breakpoints and setting different properties and features.

From here you can access the finished project:

## Week 5

The challenge this week is to introduce us to Javascript, to understand what is a variable, an argument, the different types of data that can be used, the mathematical and unary operators, what are functions and iteration cycles.
The goal is to solve, using the ES5 implementation, basic exercises on operators and variables in JavaScript, strings, arrays and for cycles, as well as to see functions.

## Week 6

This week we started a new process, we changed teams and put into practice everything we learned in week 5.The work modality continues to be individual, although collaborating with the rest of the team in a fluid way.
The weekly problem consisted in developing two additional screens of the landing page, the ones with forms, the login and the sing up.
The login section contains two fields, email and password, we had to do the corresponding validations of each one and make the connections between HTML files. For the sing up section, validations had to be performed for the fields Name, Last name, Date of birth, Address, City, ID card, zip code, email, password and phone number. All validations were made in javascript.

## Week 7

We continued working on the project and focused on connecting to the backend using an API. We had to use our sing-up registration form that sent data to the backend, received a response and stored the information in Local Storage. We used Fetch and Promises to make HTTP requests and handle errors.
